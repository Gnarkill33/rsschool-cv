### About myself

To become a junior frontend developer, I am committed to expanding my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as mastering popular frameworks like React or Angular. I plan to engage in hands-on projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and seek out learning opportunities through online courses and tutorials.

By building a strong foundation in frontend development principles and practices, I aim to develop the skills necessary to create responsive and dynamic web interfaces that meet modern design standards.

_There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!_

```javascript
function findUniq(array) {
  const result = array.filter(
    (element, index, numbers) =>
      numbers.indexOf(element) === numbers.lastIndexOf(element)
  );
  return +result;
}
```
