  <p class="info-text">
    To become a junior frontend developer, I am committed to expanding my
    knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as mastering popular
    frameworks like React or Angular. I plan to engage in hands-on projects,
    collaborate with experienced developers, and seek out learning
    opportunities through online courses and tutorials. <br>By building a
    strong foundation in frontend development principles and practices, I aim
    to develop the skills necessary to create responsive and dynamic web
    interfaces that meet modern design standards.
